# Cellulo-PONG

This is a 14 weeks Unity-engine / C# project done in collaboration with 2 other people. The goal was to create a fun game using the [Cellulos](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/chili/index-html/research/cellulo/) built by the CHILI-LAB of EPFL. 

Everyone knows the famous game of pong. However, this one is limited to a computer
game. With the new possibilities offered by the Cellulos, we decided to revisit this game
by offering the possibility to the players to not only play on the computer but also in the
real world! The game we created is a remake of the original game with quite some twists
! You are now able to enlarge or shrink the zone the Cellulo Paddles lie in, make the
Cellulo Ball go crazy, freeze your opponents, and more.
